        <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Trevor and I have been coding for about half a year now. I am still learning on several languages with basic experience in C#, HTML, CSS, and database management. Currently working on C++, JavaScript, PHP, and more C#. I hope to be able to creatively solve problems using code in the future.</p>
        <p>For work, I fly the Airbus 320 full time as an airline First Officer. Previously I was in the Army serving as an Aero-medical Evacuation Officer and UH-60 Blackhawk Pilot in Command. My wife and I recently welcomed our baby daughter to the world over the summer so much of our free time is focused on taking care of her. Other than that I try to stay into my hobbies that include watching sports, weight lifting, golfing, hunting, and skiing.</p>
        <P>My favorite books and movies are fiction. Mostly in the zombie genre. Hence why my favorite book to this day is WWZ by Max Brooks. The movie rendition did not do the book justice no matter how hard Brad Pitt tried. I think zombie movie wise my favorites are "28 Days Later" and "28 Weeks Later". "28 Years Later" seemed like they took it a different direction... it was okay. Other than that any Quentin Terentino movie I think is great.</P>
